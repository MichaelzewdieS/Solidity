# Topics Covered

As part of our Solidity learning journey, we covered the following key topics:

---

## What is Solidity?

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It's often compared to JavaScript due to its familiar syntax, but it's tailored to run on the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**.

We explored how Solidity serves as the backbone for decentralized applications (dApps), enabling trustless, tamper-proof logic on-chain.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To build and test smart contracts effectively, we set up modern development environments using tools like:

- **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)** – a blazing-fast, Rust-based toolkit for Ethereum development.
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)** – a flexible JavaScript-based framework with great support for testing and debugging.

These tools help streamline the workflow for:
- Compiling contracts
- Writing and running tests
- Deploying to local and public test networks

Setting up these environments gave us a solid foundation to experiment and iterate quickly.

## Writing Our First Smart Contract

With the environment in place, we jumped into writing our very first smart contract. Starting with simple examples, we began learning how to structure a contract, define functions and variables, and understand basic Solidity syntax.

This initial hands-on experience helped us grasp how smart contracts behave on the blockchain and what best practices to keep in mind.
