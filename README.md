# Solidity Group Project – Introduction to Blockchain (CSEg5304)

This repository serves as the collaborative workspace for our group project in the **Introduction to Blockchain** course. As a team, we are working through the [Alchemy University: Learn Solidity](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/solidity) course to gain hands-on experience with Ethereum smart contract development.

Our objective is to document our learning process, showcase our progress, and demonstrate teamwork through consistent contributions, code, notes, and resources.
