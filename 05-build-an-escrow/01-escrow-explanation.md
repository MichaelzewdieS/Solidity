# Escrow Contract Implementation

## Topics Covered

- Implementing an escrow contract
- Role-based access control
- State management

## Explanation

An escrow contract holds funds until certain conditions are met. It involves parties like:
- Buyer
- Seller
- Arbiter (optional third-party mediator)

## Notes

### Key Components
1. **Parties Involved**:
   - **Buyer**: Initiates the transaction and deposits funds
   - **Seller**: Receives funds upon condition fulfillment
   - **Arbiter**: Neutral party that resolves disputes (optional but recommended)

2. **Contract States**:
   - `AwaitingPayment`: Initial state, waiting for buyer deposit
   - `AwaitingDelivery`: Funds locked, waiting for seller to fulfill obligations
   - `Completed`: Conditions met, funds released to seller
   - `Disputed`: Conflict state requiring arbiter intervention

3. **Access Control**:
   - Critical functions should be restricted using modifiers like:
     ```solidity
     modifier onlyBuyer() {
         require(msg.sender == buyer, "Only buyer can call this");
         _;
     }
     ```

### Best Practices
- Implement timeouts for each state to prevent funds being locked indefinitely
- Clearly define dispute resolution mechanisms upfront
- Consider partial refund/partial release scenarios
- Always include cancellation terms

### Security Considerations
- Use pull-over-push pattern for withdrawals
- Guard against reentrancy attacks
- Ensure proper event logging for all state transitions
### Example 
```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Escrow {
    address public buyer;
    address public seller;
    address public arbiter;
    uint public amount;

    constructor(address _seller, address _arbiter) payable {
        buyer = msg.sender;
        seller = _seller;
        arbiter = _arbiter;
        amount = msg.value;
    }

    function releaseFunds() public {
        require(msg.sender == arbiter, "Not authorized");
        payable(seller).transfer(amount);
    }
}

     ```
